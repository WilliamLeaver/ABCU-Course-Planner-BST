# DSA-Analysis-and-Design
- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  this course was asking that we create a program that takes in a list of courses and stores it in the proper data structure for printing in an aplhabetical order.
- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I approached this problem by evaluating the cost of various tasks for each data structure and then picking the one that fit the problem
- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  I attempted to solve the extra credit problem on top of the project which required topological sorting. I did not know of this so I came up with my own solution to get the program to print out the list keeping the prereqs in mind. It was not as effecient as the sorting algo, but it did work properly.  
- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  I will now take into conisderation how I store my data. I was mostly using vectors and maps only. 
- How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  During this project I tried to make sure that my code was easy to read. I left a comment on every function to make sure that someone who was reading through the code could understand the purpose of each one
